The final project for the web development course involved making a functional webpage and hosting it on the internet. There wwas creative freedom to make any website as long as we used the material only covered in the term, i.e. html5, css, javascript and JASON.
I chose to make a website from my art portfolio and poems (that i write under my pen name, Daisy).
